# NER-using-LSTM
Named Entity Recognition problem
## Dataset: Entity Annotated Corpus
- The dataset contains text data that has been annotated with entity labels. This type of annotation is commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, particularly for tasks like named entity recognition (NER) where entities such as persons, organizations, locations, etc., need to be identified and classified within the text.
